<h1>About the program</h1>

<p>This program reads a certain description of an undirected graph and
determines the number of connected components of it.</p>

<h2>About the description of the graph</h2>

<p>The graph shall be read from a file.  The file describes
the graph by way of specifying the number of nodes, the
number of edges and a description of what nodes
each edge connects.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The input file consists only of a series of arbitrarily space-
separated integer constants written in plain ASCII, and
consequently, also readable as an UTF-8 plain text file.</p>

<p>The first two integers shall be the number of nodes (n), and the
number of edges (m), respectively.</p>

<p>Given this, the set of nodes  is assumed to be {1, 2, &hellip; n}, and
each node will be referred simply by its number.</p>

<p>Then comes &ldquo;m&rdquo; pairs of integers &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;v&rdquo; each giving the
existence of a bidirectional edge between nodes &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;v&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>The program</h1>

<p>As this program will be considerably small, it will consist of a single source file
in which we will put all of our code.</p>

<h2>Source file &ldquo;source/app.d&rdquo;</h2>

<p>The one and only source</p>

<h2>&lt; source/app.d > +=</h2>

<pre><code>void main()
{
    &gt; Content of main
}
</code></pre>

<h2>&lt; Content of main > =</h2>

<h2>&lt; Content of main > +=</h2>

<pre><code>return;
</code></pre>
