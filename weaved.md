#About the program
This program reads a certain description of an undirected graph and
determines the number of connected components of it.
##About the description of the graph
The graph shall be read from a file.  The file describes
the graph by way of specifying the number of nodes, the
number of edges and a description of what nodes
each edge connects.
###Syntax
The input file consists only of a series of arbitrarily space-
separated integer constants written in plain ASCII, and
consequently, also readable as an UTF-8 plain text file.

The first two integers shall be the number of nodes (n), and the
number of edges (m), respectively.

Given this, the set of nodes  is assumed to be {1, 2, ... n}, and
each node will be referred simply by its number.

Then comes "m" pairs of integers "u" and "v" each giving the
existence of a bidirectional edge between nodes "u" and "v".
#The program
As this program will be considerably small, it will consist of a single source file
in which we will put all of our code.
##Source file "source/app.d"
The one and only source
##< source/app.d > += 
	void main()
	{
	    > Content of main
	}
##< Content of main > = 
##< Content of main > += 
	return;
