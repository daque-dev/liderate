<section title="About the program" id="about">
  This program reads a certain description of an undirected graph and
  determines the number of connected components of it.
  <section title="About the description of the graph" id="graph-description">
    The graph shall be read from a file.  The file describes
    the graph by way of specifying the number of nodes, the
    number of edges and a description of what nodes
    each edge connects.
    <section title="Syntax" id="syntax">
      The input file consists only of a series of arbitrarily space-
      separated integer constants written in plain ASCII, and
      consequently, also readable as an UTF-8 plain text file.
